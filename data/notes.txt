sklearn.externals - what is it? 
Anaconda ?

Model is given as a Python pickle'd file (pickle?). We need to have a Python core to feed data to the model and get the result. 
Data is streamed, one sample at a time. 
Scalability? What's the problem? 
API, what's the communication method? 

What's the environment? 
System is scaled when the number of samples increases 

What are the monitoring/mertics for the production system? 

What metrics can we provide for the developer of the model? 


Project burndown: 

- Create a docker container to run the model (Anaconda installed);
- Wrap model into REST API (figure out best practice); 
- Add logging capabilities as required;
  - 
- Enable changing model 
- Load balancing task
- Caching?
